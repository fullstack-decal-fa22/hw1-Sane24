        <h2>Fictional Character Biography</h2>

        <h3>BackStory</h3>

        <p>Before the Raiden Shogun of Genshin Impact was created to serve as Ei’s vessel, the Electro Archon worked on a preliminary prototype. This first puppet would become Scaramouche, but he had no name at the time. When he gained consciousness, the unnamed puppet shed tears, leading Ei to believe that he was too gentle in nature to serve as her vessel.

            Thus, Ei sealed the young Scaramouche’s power and allowed him to follow his own path in life. She supposedly built the Genshin Impact Shakkei Pavilion located in Tatarasuna, Inazuma for him. Scaramouche then spent most of his early life there. In Genshin Impact, the Traveler can unlock the Shakkei Pavilion as a One-time Domain, and its in-game description reveals that “a deeply disheartened eccentric” once lived there – likely Ei’s yet unnamed puppet.</p>
        
        <h3>Redemption arc</h3>
        <p>Scaramouche’s story is a redemption arc done right. The story starts off pretty by the books as far as redemption arcs go, he wants to erase the sins of the past and make up for the hurt he’s caused. His entire reasoning for erasing himself was to try and save the people that he felt shouldn’t have died. Honestly, I was worried hoyoverse was going to end it there, with everyone forgetting and closing the arc with a bow.

            BUT what made the redemption arc amazing was that he FAILED. His actions failed and in the end everyone still ended up dying despite him erasing himself from history. People are still suffering the consequences of Scara’s actions, this time he just didn’t know it. Essentially, all he ended up doing was absolving himself of the mental guilt. Something he realized wasn’t right. The story culminates in him recognizing that he cannot just get rid of his actions, there are consequences and in this case, other people paid for them with their lives. Yes many circumstances were out of Scara’s control, but in the end he did make the decision to hurt. So now he will live on knowing the harm he has caused, and now must make up for it.
            
            THIS is how you redeem a character. None of that pansy “sacrifice myself so the writers don’t have to think of a real resolution” shizzle. Scara made bad decisions that hurt and killed people, now he will have to live on with those decisions, forever atoning yet knowing he must move on. I know that some people will hate on him or love him regardless of his story, so I just wanted to put this out there for all the story-enjoyers. Scara’s story quest was one of the best redemption arcs I have ever read.</p>
